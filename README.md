A website about water pollution in Howard County made by Aryan Sharma and Nirav Gill that is made to inform people about water pollution and persuade them to stop polluting water. Contains statistics, graphs, notes, and images.

NOTE: For some reason, in the GitHub Repository, only the first webpage works, and links in the nav bar don't - I don't know why. However, it still works while in my browser as an HTML file.
